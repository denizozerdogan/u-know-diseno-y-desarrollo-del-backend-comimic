U-Know is the new collaborative learning platform. Our goal is to create a community for learning and sharing knowledge. To access our community, you will need to register with your name, email, password, and create a unique username. Upon accessing your new account, you will receive 1000 knowlitos, which are the coins you can use to acquire the published courses. You can also publish your own modules on our platform and earn knowlitos, allowing you to continue learning.<br></br>
